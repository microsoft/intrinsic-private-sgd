# File system logic

## Data

Currently:
```./data/DATA_PRIVACY/datasetname + .npy```

New: de-prioritise data privacy in structure; go for flat format but more descriptive file names
The AML variant will be pulling the data from stored Datasets, but I think they're also amenable to folder structure.
